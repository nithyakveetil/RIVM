 Generalized XGBoost Classification Pipeline (R)

This repository contains a **generalized machine learning pipeline** in **R** for binary classification using **XGBoost**.  
It performs **cross-validated model training**, **ROC-AUC evaluation**, and **feature importance visualization** — all in a reproducible and easily adaptable framework.


 Features

- Cross-validated XGBoost classification (`caret` + `xgboost`)
- ROC curve and AUC computation (`pROC`)
- Automatic feature importance extraction and filtering (positive-only)
- Clean, publication-ready visualizations (`ggplot2`)
- No hard-coded file paths or output saving — ideal for GitHub and reuse
